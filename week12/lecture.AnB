Protocol: EasyID

Types: Agent A,B;
       Number M;
       Function pk, sk;
       Symmetric_key Ktemp

Knowledge: A: A, pk(A), inv(pk(A));
           B: B, pk(B), inv(pk(B));
#where A != B

Actions:

### Definition violation, since one is the assumption and the goal is the
#   same as the assumption.
#A *-> B : M
#Goals:
#A *->* B: M

### From authentic channel assumption to derive the confidential channle
#A *-> B : pk(A)
#B -> A : { M }pk(A)
#Goals:
#B ->* A: M
